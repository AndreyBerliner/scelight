[hr]
[big][b]2014 May 16 - Scelight 5.0[/b][/big]

[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-[red][i]This release comes with the option to run Scelight on Windows without Java having to be installed![/i][/red]
On Windows Operating Systems if you can't or don't want to install Java on your system, you can download a prepared JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from the Scelight [url=https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads]Downloads[/url] page and extract it into the Scelight folder.
Doing so will allow you to run Scelight without having to install Java on your system. This has to be done only once.
[i]The recommended way is still to install Java! Think of this as a last resort.[/i]

-[red][i]Merged Accounts in Multi-Replay Analyzer[/i][/red]
If you have multiple accounts and / or you play on multiple regions, you can specify all your accounts as [red][i]Merged Accounts[/i][/red] and that way you will see all your statistics summarized under one -arbitrarily chosen- main account in the Multi-Replay Analyzer. You can specify all your accounts on the Merged Accounts settings page.
This setting requires registration to be edited / changed.

-New player detail tab in the Multi-Replay Analyzer: [red][i]Region[/i][/red]
This tab shows statistics grouped by the region of the player. Useful if you use the new Merged Accounts feature.

-New player detail tab in the Multi-Replay Analyzer: [red][i]Account[/i][/red]
This tab shows statistics grouped by the accounts that were merged. Useful if you use the new Merged Accounts feature.

-Fixed a small progress bar rendering issue in tables (happened when only 1 row was added to a table).

-Scelight External Module API and SDK 1.4.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
