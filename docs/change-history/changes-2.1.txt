[big][b]2014 January 31 - Scelight 2.1[/b][/big]

[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-A new chart under the Player stats chart: [red][i]Food Made+Used[/i][/red]
This chart shows Food Made and Food Used charts at once, making it easy to see supply capped periods (when Food Used is greater than or equal to Food Made).

-[red][i]Users tab improvements[/i][/red]
A new column has been added: [red][i]Supply-capped %[/i][/red]. This shows the ratio of supply-capped time and the time of the last command of the user (this is much more informative than the supply-capped time which depends on the game length).
Columns have been reordered based on importance and [red][i]comparable metrics are now displayed as progress bars[/i][/red], making the users visually comparable.
These include the following columns: APM, SPM, SQ, Supply-capped %, Swarm Levels.

-[red][i]Search engine improvements[/i][/red]
Slightly rearranged filter properties based on importance and added new properties to filter by:

[red][i]"Is Beta / PTR?"[/i][/red]: Using this new filter you can list only Beta / PTR replays, or exclude them.
[red][i]"[Players Avg] Avg. Supply-capped %"[/i][/red]: Using this you can filter replays based on the average supply-capped percent of players.
[red][i]"Supply-capped %"[/i][/red]: This is a player filter to be applied on a player (any, all or a specific player).

The [red][i]"Is Competitive?"[/i][/red] filter now also accepts AutoMM games with version less than 2.0 (when there was no unranked games and AutoMM games were equal to ladder games).

-[red][i]Last Game info Overlay card improvements[/i][/red]
Rearranged columns based on importance and to be consistent with the Users tab, also added a new column: [red][i]SP%[/i][/red] (Supply-capped percent).

-Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when contents of sub-tabs of the Inspector tab (visible only on Developer skill level) of the Replay analyzer were scrolled with the mouse scroll wheel. 

-The External Module API design and development got a boost and jumped to version 0.6, getting closer to public release.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
