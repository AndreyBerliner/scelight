[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-[red][i]Base Control chart[/i][/red]
The Base Control chart is the successor to the Main Building Control of Sc2gears.
It visualizes Spawn Larva, Chrono Boost, Calldown MULE, Scanner Sweep and Calldown Extra Supply commands, and calculates some metrics like the Average Spawning Ratio and Average Injection Gap, also broken down to Hatcheries.
Moving the mouse cursor over any box will show details about the related command and clicking on it will jump to the corresponding command properly - as with any other chart object on any other charts.

-[red][i]Improved Template Engine[/i][/red]
New player-specific symbols which can be parameterized by a player index which must be outside of a Player Info Block and which insert the value only for the specified player.
E.g. the symbol [red][i]player1[/i][/red] will insert the name of the first player, [red][i]apm1[/i][/red] will insert the APM of the first player etc. Useful for example if you add yourself to the Favored player list, and in 1v1 games you will always be the first player and your opponent the second player.
The [red][i]mapWordsX[/i][/red], [red][i]counterX[/i][/red] and [red][i]repCounterX[/i][/red] symbols are now also parameterized and listed only once.
Of course these can also be combined with the value range, so for example [leagueLong2{1-3}] will return the first 3 letters of the 2nd player's league (your opponent if you're on the favored list).

-[red][i]New Replay list table columns: APM1, APM2, SPM1, SPM2, SQ1, SQ2, L1, L2 to return the corresponding value for the 1st and 2nd player only.[/i][/red]
The Replay list table can be sorted by these columns properly. 

-Other minor changes and improvements.
