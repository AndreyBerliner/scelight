[big][b]2014 February 20 - Scelight 3.0[/b][/big]

[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-[red][i]External Module API 1.0[/i][/red]
The External Module API has reached version 1.0 and is now public. This means everyone can now create external modules for Scelight to extend its functionalities and capabilities. 
The External Module API exposes advanced engines, components and libraries, the very [red][i]core[/i][/red] APIs that are used [red][i]internally[/i][/red] to build the UI and features of Scelight, making it possible for external modules to create UIs that are [red][i]consistent[/i][/red] with Scelight and to [red][i]deeply integrate[/i][/red] into Scelight. The Scelight External Module API is more than just an interface API: it is a [red][i]platform[/i][/red].
This means the power is in your hands, but to utilize this power you have get familiar with certain aspects, concepts and interfaces of the API (the 1.0 API exposes [red][i]hundreds[/i][/red] of interfaces and classes).
Main exposed components:
  -Application logger.
  -Language and locale specific utilities.
  -Extended and custom Swing GUI component library.
  -Settings. External modules can specify settings and integrate into the Settings dialog; take advantage of setting dependent and bound components and listen to setting changes. 
  -Replay parser engine.
  -Replay processor engine.
  -Basic SC2 Balance Data.
  -Name template engine.
  -Replay search engine.
  -SC2 monitor (current game status, live APM, game status change listening).
  -Replay folder monitor (new replay listening).
  -Sound utilities (background sound player - including MP3 format).
  -General utilities to help implement any kind of code.
More will be added / exposed in the future.
The External Module API library also contains the source code of the interface. This means whenever you use the auto-complete feature of modern IDEs (like Eclipse) or you move your mouse cursor over different parts of your code, the Javadoc of the appropriate entity (e.g. a method or interface) will be displayed to you.
The External Module API is part of the Scelight External Module SDK (see below), you can download it from the [url=https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads]Downloads[/url] page.

-[red][i]Scelight External Module SDK[/i][/red]
I have created an SDK (Software Development Kit) to aid the development of Scelight External Modules. You can download the Scelight External Module SDK from the [url=https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads]Downloads[/url] page.
The SDK is a [red][i]complete Eclipse project[/i][/red] with an Ant build script which can build releases of the external module, make deployments, install / inject it into a Scelight installation and make project backups.
The SDK also contains the External Module API library and its Javadoc.
To get started with the SDK, first download it and extract it, then use the File / Import... menu in Eclipse, choose "Existing Projects into Workspace" and select the extracted ScelightExtModSDK folder which is the Eclipse project root.
The External Module SDK also contains an example Hello World external module with source code.
External Module API, SDK and general external module development info: [url=https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/external-modules]External Modules[/url]
The Javadoc from the External Module API archive is also a number one source of information, and it is also available online for browsing here: [url=https://scelightop.appspot.com/scelight-ext-mod-api/]Scelight External Module API Javadoc[/url] 

-The Components page of the About dialog now lists loaded and started external modules too, and a new "Type" column displays the type of the components.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
