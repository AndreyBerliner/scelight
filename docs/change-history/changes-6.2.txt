Scelight 6.2: File operations, "Just Played" reps

[big][b]2015 November 27 - Scelight 6.2[/b][/big]

[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-[red][i]New File Operations: Copy / Move / Pack[/i][/red]
The Replay list page now contains 3 additional icons in the tool bar: Copy, Move and Pack Selected Replays. They do what their name say.
In all of those 3 operations you have the option to "Preserve subfolders relative to source Replay Folder".

-New setting under the Replay Folder Monitor node:
[red][i]Only pick up "Just Played" new replays[/i][/red]
If this is enabled (it is by default), only games that were just played will be picked up as new replays.
The advantage and consequence of this is that if you download replays from others or you copy / drop "old" replays into monitored replay folders, they will not be picked up and handled as "new replays". 
This extends to everything under the Replay Folder Monitor node: renaming new replays, auto-opening them in the Replay Analyzer, showing Last Game Info Overlay, Auto backup, playing 'Replay saved' voice.

-Fixed an issue where some LotV icons were not displayed properly (e.g. KD8 Charge), and Stasis Ward might even cause an error.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
