[big][b]2013 December 14 - Scelight 1.3[/b][/big]

[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-[red][i]Command line and SC2Replay file association support[/i][/red]
You can now pass replays as parameters when you start Scelight, and they will be opened in Replay analyzers.
If an instance of Scelight is already running using the same Workspace, parameters will be passed on to it, and they will be opened in the running instance (which will also be focused / selected).
[i]Recommended to associate *.SC2Replay files with Scelight.exe[/i], that way if you double click on an SC2 replay file, it will be opened in Scelight.

-[red][i]New Window menu items:[/i][/red]
"Restore default position" - Restores default window position and maximizes the window.
"Maximize Window on Start"
"Restore last Window position on Start"

-New System Tray menu item: "Restore Main window to defaults".
Restores the main window in default position and maximizes it.
Useful if your display setup changes and you can't see the window on startup (e.g. display resolution is decreased or the display on which Scelight was last displayed is removed).

-New [red][i]Launcher[/i][/red] settings page
"Auto-start when Scelight is ready" - for registered only
"Auto-start even if no connection" - for registered only

-An "Offline" button is displayed in the Status bar if Scelight is started in [red][i]Offline[/i][/red] mode (without internet connection). 

-A new button in the Replay list table tool bar: [red][i]Show Selected Replay In File Browser[/i][/red]

-Reliable User Documents folder detection.
Also on startup the derived Replay folder for the default SC2 replay folder is automatically adjusted. 

-Other minor changes and improvements.
