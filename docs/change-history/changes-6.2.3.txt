[big][b]2016 January 29 - Scelight 6.2.3[/b][/big]

[b]Changes and new features:[/b]
-------------------------------------------

-Added settings to change the font and background color of the Live APM Overlay.
Colors can be changed for both normal and alert (low APM) state: "Overlay font color", "Overlay background color", "Overlay alert font color", "Overlay alert background color". 
These can be found in the config menu of the Live APM overlay (wrench icon) and also in the Settings dialog -> SC2 Game Monitor -> Live APM page.

-On multi-screen environments dialogs are now centered relative to parent window instead of the main screen. 

-Fixed an issue where using the Search, Filter and Filter Out fields did not work as expected on columns displaying date/time values.  

-Fixed an issue where games were included in the wrong "Week" (under Timelapse in the Multi-replay Analyze) if the game was played in the last week of the year of which week ended in the next year.
 
-Other minor changes and improvements.
