-Map aliases for the Multi-Replay Analyzer.


-Ext Mod API TODOs
	-TextFilterComp, TextSearchComp, Searcher (and implementations), Ability to hook into AboutDialog (to be able to add an IPage)
	-Expose DDS image support via IRIcon? Then RIcon should implement it, and ServicesImpl.newRIcon() should return an instance of RIcon.
	-Expose RepCrawlerJob, RepCounterJob


-Add source stats to the application.
	-About dialog, Source code stats page.
	-Visible only with Developer skill level.
	-Create beans for source code stats, release build should calculate these and update the bean xml, place it under the resource folder (R)
		-This could be even part of the build-info.xml (an improved BuildInfoBean should be created, BuildInfoBean is needed as is for ext mods)
	-Each module should have separate stats, because modules might be released / updated independently.


-Indicate supply-capped periods on the Food Made+Used chart!


-General chart options, new "section": Overlays.
	An overlay: Supply-capped. It should show supply-capped periods with a gray background (bar) for example.
	Consider making it a dialog where overlays can be selected if multiple overlays are added.


-Add to errors page: unknown class major.minor version 51.0 (or something).


-Alternate (secondary) backup folder with secondary name template. Use the term mirror because rep will be copied to both folders.


-Mention in javadoc that control group chart's eventbox tooltips are calculated lazily.


-Admin "ask" summarize stats between a date range.


-In request stats report put in title where the table data comes from: reg stats from modules.xml requests, uptime stats from modules.xml.digest requests.


-EAPM


-In MRA if aliases is added and  multiple accounts are actually merged, Alias tab should be added: showing general stats for the individual merged accounts.


-Locale settings: first day of week, day end hour.


-Allow ext mod custom logger?


-About dialog, installed ext mods, new column: Loaded? Started?


-Display if extension was used, maybe some info about it (if mpq, sc2ma contains it).


-Game info tab, map name link which activates the map info tab.


-Allow repfilters to be attached specifying what reps to autosave? Our nice rep filters editor dialog could be used...


-Each filterconf monitor edit will cause to remonitoring... Needlessly... (should I care?)


-Skip-update-check-ticket.txt...


-Refresh reps count when new reps detected? (setting)


-Reg-only Logo settings: State, number of stars, gravity (these would be the initial settings).


-Option to allow html formatted emails?


-Option in email sender dialog: include info about reps.


-In player menu: Search other replays of this player in replay folder > (Submenu listing replay folders)


-Wait in createacc method until acc is saved, query in a cycle.


-New tool (official ext mod?): ping bnet servers, expandable list so e.g. teamliquid.net can be added.


-Some developer level settings can be made registration required!


-Add boolean filter for Players: Has clan logo.
	-Only worth it if Scelight does something with clan logos, e.g. fetches them and displays them.


-Put a "Close all" button on the Repanalyzers page.


-Create a Scelight Operator "clone" for people who can't reach Google.
	-Add a boot setting to choose a Scelight Operator (Requires restart).


-If workspace is in use, popup should have a button to "kill" the application that locked the workspace.
	-And should have an option to bring it forward!


-Self diagnostic.
	-Detect if the replay backup folder is a child of any monitored replay folders.


-Add global UI setting: UI control sizes, take advantage of Nimbus's sizeVariant client property:
	-component.putClientProperty("JComponent.sizeVariant", "mini"); // "large", "regular"?, "small", "mini"
	-Since some components are not added (e.g. multi-page comp), requires restart!


-TASKS THAT CAN BE WORKED ON:
	-Add more tips, source: Sc2gears Tips and Things you should know about Sc2gears...
	-Drag&drop support
	-Mouse print recorder. Use (OR MAYBE NOT - second thoughts...) LockSupport.parkNanos() to sleep (Thread.sleep() has a minimum granularity of about 12ms).
	-More charts.
	-Improved charts: "Use only displayed events as chart input"


-Right click on help and tip icons => menu or something to be able to copy the text to clipboard.


-Different name templates based on format (both for auto-rename and auto-backup).


-Filter for auto backup games.


-Add icon to IColumn (and Column setup dialog).


-Generate code names for bar code players (for example from the hashcode of their toon)


-Table menu with the following general items:
	-Select All
	-Pack
	-Export to CSV?
	-Enable column selection (not just full rows)


-Multi-page component: Close all (that closeable), maybe children of a node? To the control bar? Context menu on the tree?
	In the Rep analyzers page?


-Add boolsettings for the contents of the tool bar and status bar, e.g. "Show Running Jobs", "Show Memory Status"


-Get rid of Bean.beanVer?


-Table search optimization: row strings are assembled in a StringBuilder, then sb.toString() is used to match,
	make it so the match is checked in the string builder (thus no string allocation is required for toString()).


-Also add Search function to the Settings dialog (along with the current Filter option)?


-Add a Unified replay search field: entered value are searched "everywhere" (e.g. player name, game mode, map name etc.)
This could be implemented by searching the inner structures (which is visualized on the Raw Data Tree tab of the Rep analyzer).
Addition: explicit stating what to search, e.g. "player:dakota_fanning map:reflection" 


-Use separate icons for WoL and HotS replay analyzer pages?


-Keyboard shortcuts About page, fill automatically from Actions (and other sources?).
	Also add general keys like ESC to close a dialog.
	-CTRL+F to focus search in Settings dialog, ESC to clear search term


-multiple/different replay backup folders, chosen by (a) filter(s)


-New VersionBean property: cycle.
Enum, values: DEV, ALPHA, BETA, RC, RETAIL
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle


-Make chart system to support comparing charts from multiple replays!!


-Multi-replay analysis: allow users to assemble custom charts (select properties to calculate, select grouping properties, etc.)
