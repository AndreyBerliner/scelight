					These can be found in the config menu of the Live APM overlay (wrench icon) and also in the Settings dialog -&gt; SC2 Game Monitor -&gt; Live APM page.<br></li>
				<li>On multi-screen environments dialogs are now centered relative to parent window instead of the main screen.</li>
				<li>Fixed an issue where using the Search, Filter and Filter Out fields did not work as expected on columns displaying date/time values.</li>
				<li>Fixed an issue where games were included in the wrong "Week" (under Timelapse in the Multi-replay Analyze) if the game was played in the last week of the year of which week ended in the next year.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">New File Operations: Copy / Move / Pack</span><br>The Replay list page now contains 3 additional icons in the tool bar: Copy, Move and Pack Selected Replays. They do what their name say.<br>In all of those 3 operations you have the option to "Preserve subfolders relative to source Replay Folder".</li>
				<li>New setting under the Replay Folder Monitor node:<br><span class="h">Only pick up "Just Played" new replays</span><br>
				If this is enabled (it is by default), only games that were just played will be picked up as new replays.<br>
				The advantage and consequence of this is that if you download replays from others or you copy / drop "old" replays into monitored replay folders, they will not be picked up and handled as "new replays".<br>
				This extends to everything under the Replay Folder Monitor node: renaming new replays, auto-opening them in the Replay Analyzer, showing Last Game Info Overlay, Auto backup, playing 'Replay saved' voice.</li>
				<li>Fixed an issue where some LotV icons were not displayed properly (e.g. KD8 Charge), and Stasis Ward might even cause an error.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Added Archon mode support.</span><br>Archon mode replays are now supported (attempt to open them in the previous version caused an out of memory error and instability in Scelight).<br>
				Archon mode support includes:
				<ul><li>Archon mode is indicated in the format property with value "Archon", and as such it is visible on the Game info tab in the Replay Analyzer, in the "Format" Replay list column and in the "[format]" name template symbol.</li>
				<li>Build orders tab in the Replay Analyzer shows builds for the teams (not for individual users).</li>
				<li>Map info tab in the Replay Analyzer displays full teams as "player names".</li>
				<li>Player Stats chart and all sub-charts calculate and display data for the whole team only, these statistics have no meaning and cannot be broken down into individual users (as teams control one common base / player). These include SQ and Supply Capped %. Basically this is the same as turning on the "Teams As One" combo box for non-Archon replays. Other charts and metrics are still calculated individually for each user/player, but can be "merged" into one by enabling the "Teams As One" combo box (this also works for non-Archon replays).</li>
				<li>"Archon" appears as a new tab in the Multi-replay analyzer where statistics are aggregated / grouped by format.</li>
