			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">New File Operations: Copy / Move / Pack</span><br>The Replay list page now contains 3 additional icons in the tool bar: Copy, Move and Pack Selected Replays. They do what their name say.<br>In all of those 3 operations you have the option to "Preserve subfolders relative to source Replay Folder".</li>
				<li>New setting under the Replay Folder Monitor node:<br><span class="h">Only pick up "Just Played" new replays</span><br>
				If this is enabled (it is by default), only games that were just played will be picked up as new replays.<br>
				The advantage and consequence of this is that if you download replays from others or you copy / drop "old" replays into monitored replay folders, they will not be picked up and handled as "new replays".<br>
				This extends to everything under the Replay Folder Monitor node: renaming new replays, auto-opening them in the Replay Analyzer, showing Last Game Info Overlay, Auto backup, playing 'Replay saved' voice.</li>

				Archon mode support includes:

These include SQ and Supply Capped %. Basically this is the same as turning on the "Teams As One" combo box for non-Archon replays.

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Time trend tab in Multi-Replay Analyzer</span><br> The Time trend tab encapsulates the previous Hour and Day tabs, and adds
					further Session, Date (day of month) and Month (month of year) tabs.<br> The <span class="h">Playing Session</span> (or simply <span class="h">Session</span>)
					is a series of <span class="h">subsequent</span> plays where the break between plays is not greater than a specified limit. This limit is the Max Session
					Break and can be viewed / changed on the Multi-Replay Analyzer settings page.<br> The Time trend Session tab analyzes your Playing Sessions, and
					calculates statistics for the plays based on their <span class="h">position</span> in their Playing Sessions.<br> The value in the "Play # in session"
					column tells which play from each session is included in the row's statistics. For example the first row (Play # in session = 1) shows you statistics of
					your first plays from each session (this is when you sit down and start to play).<br> You can use this Time trend Session statistics to analyze your <span
					class="h">stamina</span> and decide how many practice plays you need before you go serious, or after how many plays you should take a break before your
					performance starts to deteriorate.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Timelapse tab in Multi-Replay Analyzer</span><br> The Timelapse tab has multiple sub-tabs: Session, Year, Month, Week, Day,
					Play. Each shows general stats aggregated for the specified time periods / granularity.<br> The Timelapse Session tab lists all your playing sessions,
					and a session stats row shows statistics for all the plays of that particular session (contrary to the Time trend Session tab which takes one play from
					each session at the most based on the play's position).<br> The final Play tab lists every single play of the player.<br> This can be used to
					view your time development, improvement over time.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Numeric columns</span> in Stats tables of the Multi-Replay Analyzer are now displayed as <span class="h">progress bars</span>
					making the rows visually comparable.<br> This basically turns all numeric columns into <span class="h">vertical bar charts</span>; or more than that
					because the table (and thus the bar chart) can be filtered and sorted by any columns.</li>

				<li>Added new columns to Map stats tabs in the Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> New columns include the <span class="h">Map size</span> column, which is
					sorted by the map area (width*height). Sorting by this you can check for example how game length relates to the map size.
				</li>

				<li>The "Races %" column in the Multi-Replay Analyzer is now rendered as a <span class="h">colored bar code</span>.<br> Each race has its color
					(based on SC2 itself: <font color="blue">Blue</font> for Protoss, <font color="green">Green</font> for Terran and <font color="red">Red</font> for Zerg),
					and the race distribution is visualized with a multi-colored bar making the used races visually standing out.
				</li>

				<li>The APM, SPM, SQ, SC % tabs have been grouped into a <span class="h">"Metric trend"</span> tab.
				</li>

				<li>Added a new "Multi-Replay Analyze Replays of the Selected Row" to the tool bar of all stats table. With this you can launch a new Multi-Replay
					Analyzer to analyze only the replays of the selected stats row.</li>

				<li>Scelight External Module API and SDK 1.2.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

					displays <span class="h">player name changes</span> (including both clan and character name changes).<br> The new <span class="h">Calendar view</span>
					shows stats grouped by day in a calendar layout, also uses different colors to indicate the total play time on each day (in Player details).<br> In
					any stats table you can select a row and <span class="h">list the replays that assemble the stats of the selected row</span> (this was a long awaited,
					missing feature in Sc2gears). The result Replay list can also be filtered further with the Scelight Replay filter system, and further filtered results can
					also be opened in a new Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> In the Multi-Replay Analyzer you also have the option to view / edit the filters that were used to
					perform the analysis, and you can fine-tune the filters to repeat the analysis in a new Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> The Replay Folders page now
					contains new 2 buttons to launch a Multi-Replay Analyzer for the selected Replay folder, with the attached or custom filters.<br> The Replay list page
					also contains a new button to Multi-Replay Analyze all listed replays (using the same source and filters), and a new button to Multi-Replay Analyze only
					the selected replays.</li>
				<li>The general table tool bar (with search and filter) now also shows the <span class="h">Selected</span> rows count along with the Listed and All

				<li>Improved Replay parser engine to better support custom games (games that failed to parse before will most likely work now).</li>
				<li>The Replay list column setup dialog now also shows an <span class="h">icon</span> column.
				</li>
				<li>Added many new icons.</li>
				<li>Numbers with fraction parts are now displayed with 2 fraction digit precision (e.g. SPM, Supply-capped %).</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">External Module API 1.0</span><br> The External Module API has reached version 1.0 and is now public. This means everyone can
					now create external modules for Scelight to extend its functionalities and capabilities.<br> The External Module API exposes advanced engines,
					components and libraries, the very <span class="h">core</span> APIs that are used <span class="h">internally</span> to build the UI and features of
					Scelight, making it possible for external modules to create UIs that are <span class="h">consistent</span> with Scelight and to <span class="h">deeply
						integrate</span> into Scelight. The Scelight External Module API is more than just an interface API: it is a <span class="h">platform</span>.<br> This means
					the power is in your hands, but to utilize this power you have get familiar with certain aspects, concepts and interfaces of the API (the 1.0 API exposes <span
					class="h">hundreds</span> of interfaces and classes).<br> Main exposed components:
					<ul>
						<li>Application logger.</li>
						<li>Language and locale specific utilities.</li>
						<li>Extended and custom Swing GUI component library.</li>
						<li>Settings. External modules can specify settings and integrate into the Settings dialog; take advantage of setting dependent and bound components
							and listen to setting changes.</li>
						<li>Replay parser engine.</li>
						<li>Replay processor engine.</li>
						<li>Basic SC2 Balance Data.</li>
						<li>Name template engine.</li>
						<li>Replay search engine.</li>
						<li>SC2 monitor (current game status, live APM, game status change listening).</li>
						<li>Replay folder monitor (new replay listening).</li>
						<li>Sound utilities (background sound player - including MP3 format).</li>
						<li>General utilities to help implement any kind of code.</li>
					</ul> More will be added / exposed in the future.<br> The External Module API library also contains the source code of the interface. This means whenever
					you use the auto-complete feature of modern IDEs (like Eclipse) or you move your mouse cursor over different parts of your code, the Javadoc of the
					appropriate entity (e.g. a method or interface) will be displayed to you.<br> The External Module API is part of the Scelight External Module SDK (see
					below), you can download it from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads">Downloads</a> page.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Scelight External Module SDK</span><br> I have created an SDK (Software Development Kit) to aid the development of Scelight
					External Modules. You can download the Scelight External Module SDK from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads">Downloads</a> page.<br>
					The SDK is a <span class="h">complete Eclipse project</span> with an Ant build script which can build releases of the external module, make deployments,
					install / inject it into a Scelight installation and make project backups.<br> The SDK also contains the External Module API library and its Javadoc.<br>
					To get started with the SDK, first download it and extract it, then use the File / Import... menu in Eclipse, choose "Existing Projects into Workspace" and
					select the extracted ScelightExtModSDK folder which is the Eclipse project root.<br> The External Module SDK also contains an example Hello World
					external module with source code.<br> External Module API, SDK and general external module development info: <a
					href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/external-modules">External Modules</a><br> The Javadoc from the External Module API archive is also a
					number one source of information, and it is also available online for browsing here: <a href="https://scelightop.appspot.com/scelight-ext-mod-api/">Scelight
						External Module API Javadoc</a></li>

				<li>The Components page of the About dialog now lists loaded and started external modules too, and a new "Type" column displays the type of the
					components.</li>

				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Chart descriptions</span><br> The Charts tab of the Replay analyzer now adds a help icon for each chart type. This help always
					shows the description of the selected chart.<br> These helps contain <span class="h">invaluable</span> info about what info you can see on the
					different charts and how they are calculated. Recommended for everyone to check these out even if you already know what the different charts are.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Supply-capped % becoming a first-class citizen.</span><br> Added "[avgSupplyCapped]", "[PIBsupplyCapped]" and
					"[supplyCappedX]" symbols to insert the average player supply-capped percent, the supply-capped percent in Player info block and the supply capped percent
					value of the Xth player.<br> Added "Avg SC%", "SC1%", "SC2%" Replay list columns which display the average supply-capped percent, and the first and
					second player's supply-capped percent values.</li>
				<li>Renamed the "SP%" (Supply-capped percent) column to "SC%" in the Last Game Info Overlay card.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>A new chart under the Player stats chart: <span class="h">Food Made+Used</span><br> This chart shows Food Made and Food Used charts at once,
					making it easy to see supply capped periods (when Food Used is greater than or equal to Food Made).
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Users tab improvements</span><br> A new column has been added: <span class="h">Supply-capped %</span>. This shows the ratio of
					supply-capped time and the time of the last command of the user (this is much more informative than the supply-capped time which depends on the game
					length).<br> Columns have been reordered based on importance and <span class="h">comparable metrics are now displayed as progress bars</span>, making
					the users visually comparable.<br> These include the following columns: APM, SPM, SQ, Supply-capped %, Swarm Levels.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Search engine improvements</span><br> Slightly rearranged filter properties based on importance and added new properties to
					filter by:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="h">"Is Beta / PTR?"</span>: Using this new filter you can list only Beta / PTR replays, or exclude them.</li>
						<li><span class="h">"[Players Avg] Avg. Supply-capped %"</span>: Using this you can filter replays based on the average supply-capped percent of
							players.</li>
						<li><span class="h">"Supply-capped %"</span>: This is a player filter to be applied on a player (any, all or a specific player).</li>
					</ul> The <span class="h">"Is Competitive?"</span> filter now also accepts AutoMM games with version less than 2.0 (when there was no unranked games and AutoMM
					games were equal to ladder games).</li>
				<li><span class="h">Last Game info Overlay card improvements</span><br> Rearranged columns based on importance and to be consistent with the Users
					tab, also added a new column: <span class="h">SP%</span> (Supply-capped percent).</li>
				<li>Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when contents of sub-tabs of the Inspector tab (visible only on Developer skill level) of the Replay
					analyzer were scrolled with the mouse scroll wheel.</li>
				<li>The External Module API design and development got a boost and jumped to version 0.6, getting closer to public release.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Filters and Replay Search</span><br> Powerful filters and advanced Replay Search have finally arrived. Predefined replay
					filters can be <span class="h">attached</span> to Replay folders, and when you want to list the contents of a Replay folder, the attached filters will be
					applied <span class="h">automatically</span>.<br> You can view/edit the attached Replay filters of a Replay folder by selecting the Replay folder and
					pressing the new "Edit Attached Filters" button. This will open the Replay Filters Editor (see below).<br> You can also <span class="h">search
						Replay folders</span> by pressing the "Search Replay Folders" button in which case a Replay Filters Editor will pop up where you can specify custom filters
					(instead of the attached filters).<br> A new "Filters" column indicates the <i>active</i> attached filters count for each Replay folder in the table.
					<i>Active</i> means it is enabled and it is valid (contains no errors).<br> The Replay list page now has a new <span class="h">"View / Edit
						Filters and Repeat Search"</span> button. This opens a Replay Filters Editor where you can view the filters that were applied when replays were listed, and you
					can also modify these filters (<i>tune</i> them) and repeat the search on the source Replay folder. Repeating the search will list the new results in a new
					Replay list page.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Replay Filters Editor</span><br> The Replay Filters Editor is used to view and edit Replay filters that are applied when
					searching / listing replays of a Replay folder.<br> <span class="h">It is table-based, equation-editor-like, easy but powerful filters editor.</span>
					It is easy to quickly add a few filters like Map name, Replay date, Version, Region etc.<br> It is also possible to build complex queries as it
					supports <span class="h">filter connections</span> like logical AND and logical OR, supports <span class="h">parenthesis (grouping of filters)</span>, and
					<span class="h">advanced operators</span> like contains, starts with, ends with and <span class="h">MATCHES</span> (regular expression matching).<br>
					The search engine supports too many properties to enumerate them all. To easily find and pick the ones you're interested in, filter properties (called
					Filter by) are organized into groups (called Filter by Group).<br> There are also special groups to filter by player properties. Special groups are at
					your disposal to filter by <span class="h">aggregate values</span> of all players of a replay (e.g. weighted average APM of all players of a replay); to
					filter by a property of <span class="h">any player</span>, of <span class="h">all players</span>, or to specify filters on <span class="h">different
						players</span> or <span class="h">multiple filters on the same player</span>.<br> There is also a <span class="h">Filters Structure Preview</span> which
					shows the structure of the filters in a <span class="h">tree-like formatted table</span>.<br> Queries like this are easily possible (you can see
					exactly this query on the image):<br> <i>"replays from the US or Europe region with HotS expansion that are longer than 10 min and were not played
						on any of the Daybreak maps and have a player named Dakota who is above Gold league and have another player with more than 50 APM with a clan tag in its
						name and have a player with Protoss race that could be anyone and average SPM of all players is at least 5 and all players have reached level 90"</i><br>
					Specifying and editing filters is done via an editable table. Just click on any cell to view your options and to edit it.<br> The constructed filters
					can also be <span class="h">saved</span> to a file or previously saved filters can be <span class="h">loaded</span> from a file.</li>
				<li><span class="h">A new Replay list column: "Played"</span><br> This column will show you the replay date in the form of played "xxx" ago (<span
					class="h">relative</span> to the current time).<br> Examples: "12m 30s" means 12 minutes and 30 sec ago, "7h 15m" means 7 hours and 15 min ago, "2w
					1d" means 2 weeks and 1 day ago, "2y 2M" means 2 years and 2 months ago.</li>
				<li>Relative date is also displayed at many other locations.</li>
				<li>Replay list progress bar now displays Added, Filtered out and Errors (renamed from Skipped).</li>
				<li><span class="h">Unfocusable Overlay cards.</span><br> Overlay cards are now not focusable by default. This means they do not hijack focus when
					they are displayed, nor do they hijack focus when you click on them. Focus remains in SC2 (or in your active application).<br> Of course you can still
					activate / open the Overlay config menu by clicking on it, but this also will not hijack the focus from SC2 (or your active application).<br> This
					focusable state can be toggled in the config menu of the Overlay card.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Moving Overlay cards outside the main screen.</span><br> By default Overlay cards cannot be moved outside the main screen, and
					this has not changed. But now the Overlay config menu contains a new option: "Allow outside the main screen". If you enable this, Scelight will not align
					the Overlay cards anymore, you will be able to position them outside the main screen, onto your additional screens if you have a multi-screen
					configuration.</li>
				<li>Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when the Events table or the Replay list table were scrolled with the mouse scroll wheel.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>
