The
<span class="s">Timelapse Session</span>

<span class="s">Playing Sessions</span>

<span class="h">all</span>
the plays of that particular
<span class="s">session</span>
(contrary to the
<span class="s">Time trend Session</span>
tab which takes one play from each
<span class="s">session</span>
