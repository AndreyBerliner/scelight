	The <span class="s">Multi-Replay Analyzer</span> takes <span class="h">multiple</span> replays as input, and calculates and displays <span class="h">aggregate</span>
	statistics and <span class="h">development trends</span>.

<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Record V-D-O</span> column displays the record of a player where <span class="s">V</span> is the number of Victories, <span class="s">D</span>
	is the number of Defeats and <span class="s">O</span> is the number of Other results (e.g. <span class="s">Unknown</span> or <span class="s">Tie</span>).

	<b>Note:</b> The <span class="h">average</span> columns like <span class="s">Avg APM</span>, <span class="s">Avg SPM</span>, <span class="s">Avg SQ</span> and
	<span class="s">Avg SC%</span> are <span class="h">weighted</span> averages where the weights are the <span class="h">length of plays</span> the individual

	<i>Tip:</i> Sorting a table by the <span class="s">Record</span> column will perform a sort by:
	<blockquote>
		<code>V - D = (victories - defeats)</code>
	</blockquote>
	This logic takes the <span class="h">number of played games</span> into consideration contrary to the <span class="s">Win %</span> column. The result order can
	be used to decide <span class="h">which maps to veto down</span> for example (the bottom of the list when sorted descending).<br>
	<div class="a">
		<b>Example #1:</b> A record of 4-36-0 (win rate = 11%) will be after a record of 1-10-0 (win rate = 10%) reflecting that a map of 4-36 record gives you more
		lost ladder points than a map with a record of 1-10.<br> <b>Example #2:</b> A record of 10-100-0 will be after a record of 1-10-0 even though having the
		same 10% win rate reflecting that 10-100 record would give you a lot more lost ladder points.
