You can also have
<span class="h">only a part</span>
of the dynamic value of
<span class="h">any</span>
symbol inserted.
<br>
<br>
To do so, before the closing square brackets of the symbol insert the wanted character range (first and last character index, starting at 1, both inclusive)
wrapped in braces in the form of
<code>{first-last}</code>
.
<br>
<br>
<div class="E">
	<b>Example:</b> To insert the substring of the map name starting from the 2nd character up to the 10th use the following expression:
	<blockquote>
		<code>[map{2-10}]</code>
	</blockquote>
	Which in case of
	<code>"Cloud Kingdom LE"</code>
	results in
	<code>"loud King"</code>
	.
</div>
