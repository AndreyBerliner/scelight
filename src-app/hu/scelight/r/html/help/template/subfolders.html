<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Template Engine</span> supports <span class="s">sub-folders</span> . This means that applying a <span class="s">name template</span> on
	replays can categorize the replays into <span class="s">sub-folders</span>. <br> Folders in the template are separated with the
	<code>"[folderSep]"</code>
	symbol.
</div>
<br>
<div class="E">
	<b>Example:</b> Let's say you want your replays in different folders based on the region they were played on, and inside the region folders have them
	categorized in folders based on game format (like 1v1, 2v2, FFA etc.). <br> <br> The following template will do just that:
	<blockquote>
		<code>[region][folderSep][format][folderSep][dateTime]&nbsp;[map]</code>
	</blockquote>
	An example output:
	<blockquote>
		<code>Europe\1v1\2013-06-28 15_23_01 Star Station.SC2Replay</code>
	</blockquote>
</div>
