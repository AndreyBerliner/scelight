<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Player Info Block</span> is a special symbol: it has a special opening and closing part (
	<code>&lt;</code>
	and
	<code>&gt;</code>
	) and some other symbols can be put <span class="h">inside</span> of it.
</div>
<br>
When applying the
<span class="s">name template</span>
on a replay, the
<span class="s">template engine</span>
will evaluate and insert the contents of the
<span class="s">Player Info Block</span>
for
<span class="h">every</span>
player in the replay, grouping players by team and separating team members with a comma and teams with the
<code>" vs "</code>
string.
<br>
<br>
<div class="E">
	<b>Example:</b> In a 2v2 game the template:
	<blockquote>
		<code>&lt;[PIBplayer] ([PIBrace])&gt;</code>
	</blockquote>
	May result in:
	<blockquote>
		<code>Bob (T), Ben (Z) vs Rob (P), Ann (P)</code>
	</blockquote>
</div>
