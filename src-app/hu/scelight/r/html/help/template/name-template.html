<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Name Template</span> is used to generate names for replay files <span class="h">dynamically</span> in a custom format of your choice,
	giving you access to properties of the replay. <br> <br> The <span class="s">name template</span> is a <span class="h">string</span> which may
	contain <span class="h">static characters (texts)</span> and special <span class="h">symbols</span> . Static characters (characters being outside of symbols)
	will be simply copied to the generated name. Symbols will be substituted with <span class="h">dynamic text values</span> taken from the replay.
</div>
<br>
The available symbols are listed in the symbol table. To insert a symbol, select it and click on the
<span class="s">Insert Selected Symbols</span>
icon or press the
<span class="k">[ENTER]</span>
key, or simply
<span class="h">double click</span>
on it.
<br>
This will perform a
<span class="h">smart insertion</span>
: if the template was valid, the symbol(s) will be inserted preferably to the current position or to the next valid position in a way that the template will
remain valid. Optionally a
<span class="s">Player Info Block</span>
might be inserted if none is added and a
<span class="s">Player Info Block</span>
specific symbol is being inserted.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> The replay file extension (
	<code>*.SC2Replay</code>
	) is added automatically to every replay, it is not needed to include it in the <span class="s">name template</span>.
