<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Base Control</span> chart visualizes <span class="h">Larva Spawning</span> for <span class="h">Hatcheries</span> and energy usage of <span
		class="h">Nexus</span> and <span class="h">Orbital Commands</span>.
</div>
<br>
<span class="h">Chrono Boosts</span>
are visualized in case of
<span class="h">Nexus</span>
grouped by the target building they are used on (each building has its own row) ,
<span class="h">Calldown: MULEs</span>
,
<span class="h">Scanner Sweeps</span>
and
<span class="h">Calldown: Extra Supplies</span>
in case of
<span class="h">Orbital Commands</span>
.
<br>
<br>
For
<span class="h">Hatcheries</span>
the chart visualizes
<span class="h">larva injections</span>
(
<span class="h">Spawn Larva</span>
commands; each targeted
<span class="h">Hatchery</span>
has its own row), and also calculates 2 very important metrics from the injections: the
<span class="s">Average Spawning Ratio</span>
and the
<span class="s">Average Injection Gap</span>
(for each
<span class="h">Hatchery</span>
which is injected at least once, and a global value for all injected
<span class="h">Hatcheries</span>
).
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Average Spawning Ratio</span> is the ratio of the time a <span class="h">Hatchery</span> is spawning larva compared to the time between its
	first injection till the end of its last injection. <i>The greater the better.</i><br> The <span class="s">Average Injection Gap</span> is the average
	time gap between time windows a <span class="h">Hatchery</span> is spawning larva. <i>The smaller the better.</i>
