<div class="D">
	<span class="s">APM</span> stands for <span class="h">Actions Per Minute</span>, it is a measurement of <span class="h">micro skills</span> of players.<br>
	<span class="s">APM</span> tells how fast players are during games. Numerically it shows how many actions / commands are issued by the player in 1 minute.
	Higher <span class="s">APM</span> means more activity.
</div>
<br>
<span class="s">APM</span>
calculation is pretty simple: one just have to divide the number of actions with the number of minutes where the actions spread in time. For example 200 actions
in 1 minute results in 200 APM.
<br>
<br>
<b>The following actions are included in <span class="s">APM</span> calculation:
</b>
<ul>
	<li>Commands (<span class="s">Cmd</span> events)
	</li>
	<li>Selections (<span class="s">SelectionDelta</span> events)
	</li>
	<li>Control group commands (<span class="s">ControlGroupUpdate</span> events)
	</li>
</ul>
<b><span class="s">APM</span> calculation does NOT include:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Screen movements (<span class="s">CameraUpdate</span> events)
	</li>
</ul>
<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">APM chart</span> visualizes the <span class="h">current</span> <span class="s">APM</span> value of players at each time of the game,
	averaging by the selected <span class="s">granularity</span> time value.
</div>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> The static <span class="s">APM</span> of a player calculated for a game excludes the first 80 seconds (can be changed) and is only counted until
	the player's last command (<span class="s">Cmd</span> event).
