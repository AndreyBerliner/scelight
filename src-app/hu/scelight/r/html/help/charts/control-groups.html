<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Control Groups</span> chart visualizes the usage of control groups (<span class="s">ControlGroupUpdate</span> events).
</div>
<br>
Visually control groups are arranged in rows. Commands that change the selection of a control group (
<span class="s">Assign</span>
) are visualized with a filled box, the control group number being in the center; commands that recall the selection of a control group (
<span class="s">Select</span>
) are visualized with the control group number itself.
<br>
<br>
<div class="T">
	<i>Tip:</i> Moving the mouse cursor over any control group number in the charts will <span class="h">show details</span> about the related control group usage,
	and clicking on it will <span class="h">jump</span> to the corresponding event in the <span class="s">Events table</span>.
