	<span class="s">SPM</span> tells how fast / frequently players are changing screens during games. Numerically it shows how many times are screens switched by
	the player in 1 minute. Higher <span class="s">SPM</span> means more / faster screen switches.
</div>
<br>
Screen changes are listed under the
<span class="s">CameraUpdate</span>
events. Only screen changes that move the screen with at least a certain distance (delta &ge; 15) are counted in
<span class="s">SPM</span>
