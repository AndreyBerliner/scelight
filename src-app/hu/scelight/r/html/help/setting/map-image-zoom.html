<div class="D">
	Map images are resized before they are displayed in tables. The <span class="s">Map image zoom</span> setting specifies the <span class="h">zoom factor</span>
	of the map images. The aspect ratio of the map images is kept during resize.
</div>
<br>
The
<span class="h">full width</span>
of the map image is always visible, only the
<span class="h">height</span>
is truncated: top and bottom parts are cut leaving its center visible based on the zoom factor.
<br>
<br>
<div class="E">
	<b>Examples:</b> <br> <br> If the zoom factor is <span class="s">100%</span> , the map image will be resized to have the height specified by <span
		class="s">Fixed table row height</span> setting therefore the <span class="h">whole map image</span> will be visible in the table. <br> <br> If the
	zoom factor is <span class="s">200%</span> , the map image will be resized to have double the height of the <span class="s">Fixed table row height</span>
	setting therefore only the <span class="h">center half of the map image</span> height will be visible etc.
