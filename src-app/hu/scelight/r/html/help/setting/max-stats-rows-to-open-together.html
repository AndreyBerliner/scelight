On the
<span class="s">Multi-Replay Analyzer</span>
page you can have the selected stats rows opened in
<span class="s">Replay Lists</span>
or in other
<span class="s">Multi-Replay Analyzers</span>
.
<br>
<br>
To avoid
<i>overloading</i>
when lots of stats rows are selected and issued to be opened, you can
<span class="h">maximize</span>
the number of stats rows that will be opened in
<span class="s">Replay Lists</span>
or in other
<span class="s">Multi-Replay Analyzers</span>
at once.
<br>
If the number of selected stats rows is greater than this limit, selected stats rows over this limit will
<b>not</b>
be opened.
