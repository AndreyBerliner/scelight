If auto-resize is enabled, the
<span class="s">Main Navigation Tree</span>
will be auto-resized when new pages are added to be as wide as the page titles.
<br>
<br>
The
<span class="s">Max auto-width</span>
setting can be used to specify the maximum width to be used when auto-resizing; the nagivation tree will not be made automatically wider than this even if page
titles are longer.
