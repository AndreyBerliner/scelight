If you are using a public email service (e.g. not a server run by you), you can only specify your
<span class="h">real email address</span>
as the sender email address else the SMTP server will either ignore the specified sender address or reject sending the email completely.
<br>
<br>
Some email services allow connecting multiple email accounts. If this applies to you, you can obviously provide any of those connected / authenticated email
addresses.
<br>
<br>
<div class="E">
	Email addresses are in the form of
	<blockquote>
		<code>user@host.domain</code>
	</blockquote>
	or
	<blockquote>
		<code>"Personal Name" &lt;user@host.domain&gt;</code>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> It is not required but recommended to put the personal name in quotes.
</div>
