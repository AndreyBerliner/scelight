When Blizzard upgrades the replay version, most of the times a new <span class="h">S2Protocol</span> definition
is required which describes how to parse the new replay version.
<br>
<br>
The release of the new <span class="h">S2Protocol</span> might be delayed for an unknown time,
and even when / if it is released, it takes time to release a new ${appName} version
that contains the new <span class="h">S2Protocol</span> definition.
<br>
<br>
At the same time, often there is no change in the <span class="h">S2Protocol</span> definition
that is used to parse the new replay version, so often the latest known
<span class="h">S2Protocol</span> is enough / valid to use to parse the newer replay version.
However, it cannot be told in advance if the new <span class="h">S2Protocol</span> definition
contains any changes. If it does, parsing these new replays will most likely fail.
<br>
<br>
With the <span class="s">Use latest S2Protocol definition</span> setting you can instruct ${appName} to use the latest available (bundled) S2Protocol
for parsing when a newer, unknown replay version is encountered.
