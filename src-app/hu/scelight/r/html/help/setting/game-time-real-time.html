There are 2 kinds of time measurements.
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	The one we all know and use in our real life is referred to as <span class="s">real-time</span>. In StarCraft II Blizzard uses a different
	time measurement referred to as <span class="s">game-time</span>.<br><br>
	Note that <span class="s">game-time</span> is identical to <span class="s">real-time</span> in Legacy of the Void expansion,
	but it differs in Wings of Liberty and in Heart of the Swarm expansions.<br><br>
	Game-time <span class="h">depends on the game speed</span> and is equivalent to the real-time on
	<span class="s">Normal</span> game speed and is approximately <span class="h">1.38 times faster</span> compared to the real time on <span class="s">Faster</span>
	game speed (which means 1 minute and 24 seconds game-time is equal to 1 minute real-time).
</div>
<br>
Blizzard only shows you game length, time charts and build order information in
<span class="s">game-time</span>
.
<br>
<br>
<b>Pros</b>
of
<span class="s">game-time</span>
is that it does not depend on the game speed, a build order will contain the same times regardless of the game speed.
<br>
<b>Cons</b>
of
<span class="s">game-time</span>
is that it is simply unnatural and creates confusion.
<br>
<br>
Since all ladder matches are to be played on Faster game speed, and the number of games played on non-faster game speed is negligible, the pros of
<span class="s">game-time</span>
quickly fade away. The use of
<span class="s">real-time</span>
is recommended.
