The
<span class="s">Multi-Replay Analyzer</span>
can merge multiple accounts into one
<span class="h">main</span>
account, and show the statistics of the merged accounts summarized under the
<span class="h">main</span>
account.
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Merged Accounts</span> specification is a <span class="h">multi-line</span> text. Each line specifies the different accounts of one <span
		class="h">main</span> account as a <span class="h"> comma separated toon list</span>. The <span class="h">first toon</span> must be the <span class="s">toon</span>
	of the &mdash;arbitrarily chosen&mdash;<span class="h">main</span> account: you will see the merged account appear as this everywhere in the <span class="s">Multi-Replay
		Analyzer</span>.
</div>
<br>
This is particularly useful if you have multiple accounts and / or you play on multiple regions, because by specifying all your accounts as
<span class="s">Merged Accounts</span>
you can see your overall statistics.
<br>
<br>
<div class="T">
	<i>Tip:</i> You can also use the <span class="s">Merged Accounts</span> feature for accounts other than yours, this is not restricted to one person (e.g. you
	can also specify the multiple accounts of your friends, but of course place each of your friend on a different / new line).
</div>
<br>
<div class="E">
	<b>Example:</b> The following <span class="s">Merged Accounts</span> text defines 2 <span class="h">main</span> accounts:
	<blockquote>
		<code>2-S2-1-206154-[SL]Dakota, 1-S2-1-2797613-[SL]Dakota</code>
		<code>1-S2-1-1234-Bob, 1-S2-1-1235-Rob, 2-S2-1-1236-Alice</code>
	</blockquote>
	The first <span class="h">main</span> account will be
	<code>2-S2-1-206154-[SL]Dakota</code>
	merging
	<code>2-S2-1-206154-[SL]Dakota</code>
	and
	<code>1-S2-1-2797613-[SL]Dakota</code>
	.<br> The second <span class="h">main</span> account will be
	<code>1-S2-1-1234-Bob</code>
	merging
	<code>1-S2-1-1234-Bob</code>
	,
	<code>1-S2-1-1235-Rob</code>
	and
	<code>2-S2-1-1236-Alice</code>
	.
</div>
