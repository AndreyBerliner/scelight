${appName} can monitor replay folders for you, and when
<span class="h">new replays</span>
are detected in these folders, certain actions can be performed.
<br>
<br>
With this setting you can make ${appName} only pick up replays that were
just played. The advantage and consequence of this is that if you
download replays from others or you copy / drop "old" replays into
monitored replay folders, they will not be picked up and handled as "new
replays".
<br>
<br>
This extends to everything under the
<span class="s">Replay Folder Monitor</span>
node.
