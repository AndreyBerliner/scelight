In many cases game format is not recorded accurately in replays (mostly in
<span class="s">Private</span>
and
<span class="s">Public</span>
games).
<br>
<br>
${appName} can detect the accurate game format based on the
<span class="h">matchup</span>
, and as a result you will see exact game format like
<span class="s">2v2</span>
instead of just seeing
<span class="s">Custom</span>
.
