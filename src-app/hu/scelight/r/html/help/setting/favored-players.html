<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Favored Player List</span> is a list of your <span class="h">favored</span> players, typically your own accounts (including <span class="h">all</span>
	if you have <span class="h">multiple</span> accounts or if you play on <span class="h">multiple</span> regions).
</div>
<br>
When you open or rename a replay, the
<span class="s">Replay Processor</span>
<span class="h">rearranges</span>
players and their teams so that favored players (and their teams) are put ahead of others and therefore always displayed / listed first.
<br>
<br>
The
<span class="s">Replay list</span>
table can also color rows based on match result of favored players.
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	Players are identified by a text referred to as the <span class="s">Toon</span> which contains numbers that uniquely identify an account, realm and region.
</div>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> The player name is <span class="h">not</span> part of the <span class="s">toon</span> therefore if you use the <i>Name change</i> feature of
	Battle.net your <span class="s">toon</span> remains the same. But arbitrary you can, and it's recommended to append the player name to the end of the <span
		class="s">toon</span> separated with a dash character (
	<code>'-'</code>
	) so you will remember who that <span class="s">toon</span> belongs to, for example: <br>
	<blockquote>
		<code>2-S2-1-206154-DakotaFannin</code>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<br>
The favored player list is specified by a
<span class="h"> comma separated toon list</span>
.
<br>
<br>
<div class="T">
	<i>Tip:</i> You can edit the favored player list manually <i>or</i> you can add / remove players from the <span class="s">Player menu</span> by clicking on the
	<span class="s">Add to the Favored Player list</span> or <span class="s">Remove from the Favored Player list</span> items.
