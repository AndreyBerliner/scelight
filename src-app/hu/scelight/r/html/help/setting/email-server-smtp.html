Emails are sent by connecting and passing the email to the SMTP server of your email provider. Most email providers publish their SMTP server parameters in
their help. You have to ask your email provider if you don't know or you can't find the SMTP server parameters in their help.

Your email provider may not grant you SMTP access in which case you will not be able to send emails via that email account.
