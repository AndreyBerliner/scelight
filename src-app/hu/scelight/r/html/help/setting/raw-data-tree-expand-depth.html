<span class="s">GAME EVENTS</span>
and
<span class="s">TRACKER EVENTS</span>
nodes contain
<i>lots</i>
of child nodes. Expanding all of them recursively could take even several minutes (and usually expanding fully is not even intended / wanted).
<br>
<br>
To avoid this, you can set the max expand depth of these 2 big nodes. A value of
<span class="s">0</span>
will
<span class="h">not</span>
expand
<span class="s">GAME EVENTS</span>
and
<span class="s">TRACKER EVENTS</span>
. A value of
<span class="s">1</span>
will only show their
<span class="h">children</span>
, a value of
<span class="s">2</span>
only their
<span class="h">grandchildren</span>
etc.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> This depth only applies when you expand them with the <span class="s">Expand Selected</span> or <span class="s">Expand All</span> buttons.
	Manually you will still be able to expand to any depth.
</div>
