When enabled in the settings, you can move the main tool bar by simply
<span class="h">dragging</span>
it with your mouse.
<br>
<br>
You can drag and drop the tool bar on the four sides of the main window:
<span class="s">North</span>
,
<span class="s">East</span>
,
<span class="s">South</span>
and
<span class="s">West</span>
. While dragging it, you can also release it
<span class="h">anywhere else</span>
in which case the Tool bar will be
<span class="h">detached</span>
and will float above the main window.
<br>
<br>
The floating Tool bar can be
<span class="h">attached back</span>
to the main window by simply
<span class="h">closing</span>
it with the red X icon or dragging and releasing it above one of the four sides of the main window.
