Each column offered to you in the
<span class="s">Replay list</span>
table displays a well defined property of the replays (e.g. the
<span class="s">Version</span>
column displays the version of the replays).
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	With <span class="s">Custom columns</span> you have the possibility to tell <span class="h">what properties</span> of the replays you want to display and <span
		class="h">in what format</span>. <br> <br> A <span class="s">Custom column</span> is a column which you can <span class="h">name</span> as you like,
	and you can <span class="h">define its value</span> in the form of a flexible <span class="h">template</span>.
</div>
<br>
The template of a
<span class="s">Custom column</span>
will be evaluated by the
<span class="s">Template engine</span>
for each replay, and the result file name will be displayed (without folder name and extension) under the
<span class="s">Custom column</span>
.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> <span class="s">Custom columns</span> can be made visible or hidden on the <span class="s">Replay List Column Setup</span> dialog.
</div>
