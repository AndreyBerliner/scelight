If enabled, ${appName} can open detected new replays automatically in the
<span class="s">Replay Analyzer</span>
.
<br>
<br>
To avoid
<i>overloading</i>
when lots of new replays are dropped into monitored replay folders, you can
<span class="h">maximize</span>
the number of opened
<span class="s">Replay Analyzers</span>
. New
<span class="s">Replay Analyzers</span>
will
<b>not</b>
be opened if the number of opened
<span class="s">Replay Analyzers</span>
reaches this limit.
