Many times in team games if a player leaves the game, the match result is
<span class="h">not yet</span>
decided therefore the match result
<span class="h">cannot</span>
(and will not)
<span class="h">be recorded</span>
in the replay.
<br>
<br>
If the game result info is
<span class="h">missing</span>
from the replay, ${appName} can
<span class="h">deduce</span>
the winners by tracking the teams and leaving players, and
<span class="h">declare</span>
the largest remaining team winner.
<br>
<br>
Since most of the times
<span class="h">defeated</span>
players leave first, estimating winners by the largest remaining team gives a
<span class="h">very accurate</span>
result.
