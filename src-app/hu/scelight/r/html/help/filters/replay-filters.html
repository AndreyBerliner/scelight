<div class="D">
	<span class="s">Replay Filters</span> are a list of <span class="h">conditions on replay properties</span>, and they specify what replays to <span class="h">include</span>
	in the <span class="s">Replay list</span> table, excluding those that <span class="h">do not match</span> the filters.
</div>
<br>
Filters can be connected with logical
<span class="h">AND</span>
(both filters on its side must match) or with logical
<span class="h">OR</span>
(only one filter on its side is enough to match).
<br>
<br>
The
<span class="h">AND</span>
has higher precedence than
<span class="h">OR</span>
, always the
<span class="h">AND</span>
connections are evaluated first.
<br>
You can use different variations of the logical connection which insert
<span class="h">parenthesis</span>
to
<span class="h">group the filters</span>
. Filters inside parenthesis take precedence in evaluation. Missing opening parenthesis will be inserted before the first filter, and missing closing
parenthesis will be inserted after the last filter.

	<b>Example #1:</b> Replays that are from the Korean region with HotS expansion <i>or</i> are from the US region and were not played on the map Daybreak LE:
	<blockquote>
		<code>Region=Korea AND Expansion=HotS OR Region=US AND Map name&ne;'Daybreak LE'</code>
	</blockquote>

	<b>Example #2:</b> Replays that are not played on any Daybreak maps and are either from the Korean or US region:
	<blockquote>
		<code>Map name does not contain 'Daybreak' AND (Region=Korea OR Region=US)</code>
