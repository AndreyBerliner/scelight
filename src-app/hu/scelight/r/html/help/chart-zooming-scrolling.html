Charts can be zoomed in 2 ways which can be
<span class="h">combined</span>
and
<span class="h">repeated</span>
arbitrarily.
<h3 style='margin-bottom: 3px;'>
	1. Zooming with <span class="s">markers</span>
</h3>
<div class="D">
	<span class="s">Markers</span> are stored time values which are visualized on the charts as vertical dashed lines.
</div>
<br>
You can zoom any arbitrary time window of the charts by
<span class="h">marking the beginning and the end</span>
of the time frame you want to zoom into, and pressing the
<span class="s">Zoom into markers</span>
button.
<br>
You can set 2
<span class="s">markers</span>
by clicking on the chart with the
<span class="h">left</span>
and
<span class="h">right</span>
buttons of your mouse. The
<span class="s">left marker</span>
is also synchronized to the
<span class="s">events table</span>
: it is updated automatically to reflect the time of the selected event.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> The <span class="s">left marker</span> if not set will be the <span class="h">beginning of the replay</span>, the <span class="s">right
		marker</span> if not set will be the <span class="h">end of the replay</span>.
</div>
<br>
<div class="T">
	<i>Tip:</i> You can clear a marker if you hold down the <span class="k">[CTRL]</span> key while clicking.
</div>
<h3 style='margin-bottom: 3px;'>2. Zooming with mouse scroll wheel</h3>
Hold down the
<span class="k">[CTRL]</span>
key and rotate your mouse scroll wheel
<span class="h">up</span>
to
<span class="h">zoom in</span>
or rotate
<span class="h">down</span>
to
<span class="h">zoom out</span>
. The mouse cursor will be the center of the zoom.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	The <span class="s">Reset zoom</span> button will always reset the zoom and show the whole charts.
</div>
<h3 style='margin-bottom: 3px;'>Scrolling</h3>
When the charts are zoomed, a horizontal scroll bar appears under the charts which you can use to scroll the charts.
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	The charts are also <span class="s">drag-scrollable.</span> This means that zoomed charts can simply be scrolled by dragging them with your mouse.
</div>
<br>
<div class="T">
	<i>Tip:</i> You can also <span class="h">enlarge</span> the charts by clicking on the <span class="s">Enlarge charts</span> button <i>or</i> clicking on the
	charts with the <span class="h">scroll wheel</span> mouse button. Press the <span class="k">[ESC]</span> button or click again with the <span class="h">scroll
		wheel</span> mouse button to restore the enlarged charts.
