It is a very common and frequent task to open the replay you played last in the
<span class="s">Replay Analyzer</span>
(e.g. you just finished a game, and you want to check the last game's statistics).
<br>
To ease this task, the
<span class="s">Quick Open Last Replay</span>
function does this for you with one click.
<br>
<br>
The last replay is looked for
<span class="h">in all of the</span>
<span class="s">monitored replay folders</span>
(also respecting their
<i>"Include sub-folders?"</i>
property to decide whether to search sub-folders too).
<br>
<br>
<div class="D">
	The <i>last replay</i> is defined as the <span class="h">latest</span> replay according to the <span class="h">last modified time</span> of the replay files.
</div>
<br>
This (also) means that if you download a new replay to any of the
<span class="s">monitored replay folders</span>
,
<i>that</i>
will be recognized as the last replay (even though the game might have been played
<i>earlier</i>
than your other replays).
