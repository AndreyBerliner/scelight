<br>
The
<span class="s">Time trend Session</span>
tab analyzes your
<span class="s">Playing Sessions</span>
, and calculates statistics for the plays based on their
<span class="h">position</span>
in their
<span class="s">Playing Sessions</span>
.
<br>
The value in the
<span class="s">Play # in session</span>
column tells which play from
<span class="h">each</span>
<span class="s">session</span>
is included in the row's statistics.
<br>
<br>
<div class="E">
	<b>Example:</b> The first row (
	<code>Play # in session = 1</code>
	) shows you statistics of your first plays from each session (this is when you sit down and start to play).<br> The second row (
	<code>Play # in session = 2</code>
	) shows you statistics of your second plays from each session, this is the statistics of all your <span class="h">second</span> plays.<br>
</div>
<br>
You can use the
<span class="s">Time trend Session</span>
statistics to analyze your
<span class="h">stamina</span>
and decide how many practice plays you need before you go serious, or after how many plays you should take a break before your performance starts to
deteriorate.
