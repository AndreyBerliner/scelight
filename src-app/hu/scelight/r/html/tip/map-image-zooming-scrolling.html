You can change the map image zooming by selecting the desired zoom value in the
<span class="s">Zoom</span>
drop down list or you can hold down the
<span class="k">[CTRL]</span>
key and use your
<span class="h">scroll wheel</span>
(middle button) of your mouse.

<div class="D">
	The Map image is <span class="s">drag-scrollable</span>. This means that if the map image does not fit on the screen and scrollbars appear, you can simply
	scroll the map image by dragging it with your mouse.
</div>

This is also indicated by the
<span class="h">move</span>
