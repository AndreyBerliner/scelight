	<b>${appName} runs in <span class="h">Offline</span> mode!
	</b>
	<br>
	<br> This means the ${launcherName} was not able to contact
	<br>the ${operatorName} on startup, and updates could not be checked.
	<br>
	<br>Automatic and manual update checks are also disabled.
	<br>Your ${appName} might be out-dated.
	<br>
	<br>You must restart ${appName} to check for updates.
