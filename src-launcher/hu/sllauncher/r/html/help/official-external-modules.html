	Please also read the general <span class="s">External Modules</span> help! (You find it next to this help icon).

<div class="D">
	<span class="s">Official external modules</span> are <span class="h">general purpose</span> <span class="s">external modules</span> from <span class="h">cooperating</span>
	3rd party developers and vendors.
</div>
<br>
<span class="s">Official external modules</span>
are listed on this page, and they can be installed with one click, and have auto-updated. When an
<span class="s">official external module</span>
is installed, it is
<span class="h">disabled</span>
by default. You have to
<span class="h">manually enable</span>
it on the
<span class="s">Installed Modules</span>
page.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> When you disable auto-update for an <i>installed</i> <span class="s">official external module</span>, the module <span class="h">will
		remain installed</span> in your ${appName} and you can keep using it (only it will not be auto-updated until you re-enable auto-update for it). To permanently
	uninstall / remove a module, you also have to go to the <span class="s">Installed Modules</span> page and delete / uninstall it.

Since
<span class="s">Official external modules</span>
are also
<b>NOT</b>
developed by me, the same policy applies to them too (
<b>I take zero responsibility</b>
for damages caused by them).

<div class="W">
	ONLY INSTALL <span class="s">OFFICIAL EXTERNAL MODULES</span> THAT COME FROM TRUSTED AUTHORS!
