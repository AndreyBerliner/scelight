<div class="D">
	The <span class="s">Log Level</span> setting controls how detailed the log files managed by ${appName} should be.
</div>
<br>
Primary goal of log files is to give
<span class="h">help</span>
later for
<span class="h">bug and error analysis</span>
if something goes wrong in ${appName}.
<br>
Log files can be browsed and filtered inside ${appName}, but usually you don't need to do that. They are mainly needed if you encounter an error or a
misbehaving, and you want to report a bug to the ${appName} author. In a bug report, you should always include your log files.
<br>
<br>
<span class="s">${error}</span>
log level entries indicate that something is not right or not how / what it should be; at least not under normal circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<span class="s">${warning}</span>
log level entries indicate potential problems or malfunctioning.
<br>
<br>
<span class="s">${info}</span>
log level entries are human readable and are intended for the user.
<br>
<br>
<span class="s">${debug}</span>
log level entries contain useful info about what is happening in the background.
<br>
<br>
The
<span class="s">${trace}</span>
log level also includes internal variables and program state useful only when analyzing anomalies.
<br>
<br>
Generally speaking the log level of
<span class="s">${debug}</span>
is recommended and is sufficient.
