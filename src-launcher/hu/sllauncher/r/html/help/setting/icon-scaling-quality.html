<div class="D">
	Every icon and image when displayed needs to be scaled, resampled to their display size if it is not equal to their original size. The <span class="s">Icon
		scaling quality</span> setting chooses the <span class="h">algorithm</span> and defines the result image <span class="h">quality</span>.
</div>
<br>
The
<span class="s">Low</span>
quality is the fastest but may result in blocky images. It uses the nearest neighbour interpolation algorithm.
<br>
<br>
The
<span class="s">Medium</span>
quality results in much smoother images than the
<span class="s">Low</span>
quality as there are no blocky edges between the colors. It uses the bilinear interpolation algorithm of the 4 nearest pixels.
<br>
<br>
The
<span class="s">High</span>
quality offers slightly better quality than the
<span class="s">Medium</span>
quality. It uses a cubic interpolation of the 9 nearby pixels.
<br>
<br>
<div class="W">
	The <span class="s">High</span> quality on some computers (where there is no suitable hardware acceleration) may cause ${appName} to slow down significantly
	(especially when zoomed map images are displayed). If you experience this, use the <span class="s">Medium</span> quality instead!
