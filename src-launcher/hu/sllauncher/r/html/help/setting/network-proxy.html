<div class="D">
	In computer networks, a <span class="h">proxy server</span> is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from
	clients seeking resources from other servers.

You may configure to use a Proxy server to connect to the internet if your computer cannot directly reach the internet or the
<span class="s">${appOpName}</span>

<br>
<br>
The
<span class="s">HTTP Proxy</span>
is used when estabilishing a
<span class="h">non-secure</span>
connection to an HTTP (web) server.
<br>
The
<span class="s">HTTPS Proxy</span>
is used when estabilishing a
<span class="h">secure</span>
connection to an HTTPS (secure web) server.
<br>
The
<span class="s">SOCKS Proxy</span>
is used when estabilishing a connection not covered by the aforementioned 2 proxies. This is a TCP/UDP level proxy.
<br>

<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> ${appName} always uses a <span class="h">secure</span> connection to contact the <span class="s">${appOpName}</span> which means the <span
		class="s">HTTPS Proxy</span> applies in this case.
