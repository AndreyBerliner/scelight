${appName} has lots of settings defining how and what data is presented to you, and how ${appName} operates internally. You can customize and tweak ${appName}
on a wide scale with these settings.
<br>
<br>
To help you find the setting you are looking for, you can enter a
<span class="h">filter term</span>
, and the displayed settings will be
<span class="h">filtered</span>
,
<span class="h">narrowed down</span>
immediately. The filter term is not case sensitive.
<br>
<br>
When the filter is
<span class="h">active</span>
, only the settings that
<span class="h">contain the filter term</span>
will be displayed, and a
<span class="h">green</span>
background will notify you that the displayed settings are filtered and you might see an incomplete setting list.
<br>
<br>
You can clear the filter by
<span class="h">clearing the filter term</span>
, or clicking on the
<span class="h">cross</span>
icon next to the filter text field, or by pressing the
<span class="k">[ESC]</span>
key.
<br>
<br>
<div class="N">
	<b>Note:</b> Pressing the <span class="k">[ESC]</span> key twice or pressing it when the filter is inactive or not focused will close the <span class="s">Settings
		dialog</span>.
</div>
<br>
<div class="T">
	<i>Tip:</i> You can focus the filter text field by pressing <span class="k">[CTRL+F]</span> .
