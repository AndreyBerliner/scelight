<div class="D">
	<span class="s">External Modules</span> are software components that can be integrated into and run along with ${appName}, but they are developed and
	maintained <span class="h">independently</span> from ${appName} by <span class="h">3rd party developers</span> and <span class="h">vendors</span> .

<br>
<span class="s">External modules</span>
can be great assets to make your ${appName} and StarCraft II experience

.

Since

are

developed or maintained by me, you should have the same reservations about them as about any applications you download from the internet.

Since
<span class="s">external modules</span>
are
<b>NOT</b>
developed by me,
<b>I take zero responsibility</b>
for what they do or how they do it. (This also applies to
<span class="s"><i>Offical</i> external modules</span>
.)
<br>
<span class="h">Poorly</span>
or
<span class="h">viciously</span>
written modules can make your ${appName} or your whole system
<span class="h">slow</span>
,
<span class="h">unstable</span>
, or can even
<span class="h">damage</span>
it! External modules can also
<span class="h">access and steal private data</span>
from your computer!

<div class="W">
	AGAIN: ONLY INSTALL <span class="s">EXTERNAL MODULES</span> THAT COME FROM TRUSTED SOURCES!
