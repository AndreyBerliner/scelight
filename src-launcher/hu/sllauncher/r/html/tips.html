	<h1>General ${appName}&trade; Tips</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>You can get rid of the mandatory startup delay and all other limitations by <span class="h">registering</span>.
			For details visit the <a href="${urlReginfoPage}">Registration info</a> page.<br>
			Registration is a <span class="h">one-time action</span>, it does not expire, you don't have to renew it.
		</li>
		<li>On Windows Operating Systems if you can't or don't want to install Java, you can download a prepared JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from the
			${appName} <a href="${urlDownloadsPage}">Downloads</a> page and extract it into the ${appName} folder. Doing so will allow you to run ${appName} <span
			class="h">without having to install Java</span> on your system. You only have to do this once.<br> <i>The recommended way is still to install Java!
				Think of this as a last resort.</i>
		</li>
		<li>By default players are listed as they appear in replays. Add yourself to the <span class="s">Favored Player List</span>, and you (and your team) will
			always be listed and displayed first.<br>To do that, click on the <span class="s">Player menu</span> in the <span class="s">Replay Analyzer</span>, and
			choose <span class="s">Add to the Favored player list</span>. You can also edit the <span class="s">Favored Player List</span> manually on the <span
			class="s">Replay Processor</span> settings page.
		</li>
		<li>You can pass replays as parameters when you start ${appName}, and they will be opened in <span class="s">Replay analyzers</span>.<br> If an
			instance of ${appName} is already running using the same <span class="s">Workspace</span>, parameters will be passed on to it, and they will be opened in the
			running instance (which will also be focused / selected). <br> Recommended to associate <code>*.SC2Replay</code> files with <code>Scelight.exe</code> on
			Windows OS, that way if you double click on an SC2 replay file, it will be opened in ${appName}.
		</li>
		<li>If you have multiple accounts and / or you play on multiple regions, you can specify all your accounts as <span class="s">Merged Accounts</span> and
			that way you will see all your statistics summarized under one&mdash;arbitrarily chosen&mdash;<span class="h">main</span> account in the <span class="s">Multi-Replay
				Analyzer</span>. You can specify all your accounts on the <span class="s">Merged Accounts</span> settings page.
		</li>
		<li>The <span class="h">32-bit Java</span> runs on both 32 and 64-bit Operating Systems and <span class="h">uses much less memory</span> (could be even
			70% less)! <br> If memory is an issue, it is recommended to install and use the 32-bit Java (uninstall the 64-bit Java if you have both).
		</li>
